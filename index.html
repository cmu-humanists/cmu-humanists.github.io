      Proponents of assisted suicide think that being able to plan their own deaths helps people with unmitigatable suffering or high near-term chances of death regain control (or at least the feeling of control) over their lives. Proponents also think that planned deaths can help improve quality of life by avoiding unnecessary suffering by the person committing suicide and by her loved ones. Opponents of assisted suicide think that it stigmatizes disability, and legitimizes death as a solution to problems. Opponents are also concerned that allowing assisted suicide creates more opportunities for people to pressure themselves or others into suicides for reasons the opponents think are illegitimate.

      What is religion? What systems should we use to classify something as a religion? Most theological scholars would define religion as any system of belief or worship. While others may say that believing in a supernatural power or powers is what fundamentally makes something a religion. Should religion be defined by its practices? Should fundamentalist or fringe groups, such as Westboro Baptist Church and ISIS, still be considered religious and extended the same rights and protections as religions? What does our definition of religion mean for atheism or agnosticism, and can they counted as a religion at all?Does classifying certain beliefs as religion give them legitimacy in the public eye or protect them from scrutiny? Such arguments have been made about Scientology, where some would argue it is a religion, while others say it is a cult. Should we be more harsh or more inclusive in our definition of religion, and what impacts may that have on how much power they control?Furthermore, why do we care? For legal purposes, what does and does not count as a religion can have big consequences. From tax exemption, to getting days off work, to being allowed to not have your children vaccinated, beliefs with the special status of religion can have far reaching impacts on our society and day to day life.

      What is the difference between humans and animals? Biologically or psychologically, the differences are immediately apparent: humans have unmatched language, rationality, adaptability, cooperation, and accomplishments. However, less obvious to many is the existence of a moral difference between humans and other animals.Many argue that humans are not morally distinct from animals because their physical differences, such as a higher brain mass to body mass ratio than those of other animals, do not warrant moral distinction. Others argue that these same physical differences result in significant differences in morally relevant qualities like consciousness or knowledge.On the spiritual side, some argue that spiritual qualities shared among all animals render even the most physically significant differences morally insignificant. Others believe that only humans are endowed with certain spiritual qualities, like souls, that make them morally distinct from animals.As you can see, a lot of disagreement on this question hinges on disagreements over what is morally significant. What is your criteria for determining moral significance? What is the value that your criteria leads you to place in animals? How does this value compare to the value that you place in humans?

      For centuries, it has seemed to many that we must choose between the realism of a secular worldview and the comforts of a religious worldview.  But what if we could have both?  Suppose we combined the idea that nature is probably all there is (“naturalism”) with communities and practices designed to invoke awe, reverence, and spiritual uplift (“religions”).  Can we dispense with questionable claims about supernatural agency and still help people connect with something larger than themselves?  What would that look like?  Are there real-world examples of this phenomenon?  Do they “work” for people?  Can a thoroughly naturalistic worldview satisfy people’s need for connection, meaning, and transcendence?  If not, why not?  If so, why—and more importantly, how?  And should the result of such efforts be classified as a kind of religion?

      From the more Utopian visions of a world like in Star Trek, Her, or Sir Thomas More’s Utopia which coined the term Utopia. To the more Dystopian visions of Blade Runner, The Hunger Games, or Orwell’s 1984. We have often thought of what our ideal world might look like. A world without suffering and illness, or poverty and greed, or a world where no has to work, or where all evil is eliminated. But perhaps Sir Thomas More was trying to tell us something about Utopia in the word he coined from the greek οὐ (“not”) and τόπος (“place”), and so Utopia means “no-place”. As the dystopian literature has shown us, a utopian vision could easily become twisted into dystopia if you’re not careful what you wish for. In many ways our ideas about utopias and dystopias tell us about the kind of world we live in and our cultural aspirations and fears, and we maybe we learn something from them that helps us move towards a real life utopia, if that is indeed something we should strive for.
