# Our Mission
The mission of Humanist League is to build an inclusive, values-based community dedicated to breaking down the ideological barriers to widespread human flourishing.  To this end, we celebrate freedom of inquiry in the domains of ethics, politics and theology, and promote constructive dialogue and mutual understanding on subjects that traditionally divide humanity.

# Our Objectives:
* Build a close community committed to core humanist values.
* Provide a vital social space where members can safely engage in the collaborative testing of ethical, existential, theological and political hypotheses.
* Engage the adherents of other outlooks in open, honest dialogue aimed at mutual understanding.
* Promote humanism as a promising value foundation for harmonious co-existence, collaborative problem solving and a brighter future.
