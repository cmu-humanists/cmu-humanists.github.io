  name: Chanel Menocal
  bio: "Hey, I'm Chanel and I'm the VP/ Treasurer for The Humanist League. I'm majoring in Civil Engineering and looking to specialize in public structures. I like to find a common ground between two arguments and then figure out why one should choose one opinion over the other based on its facts, because I believe most arguments can be traced back to an objective truth. On my free time, I like to discover new bands (many of which are local to Pittsburgh),  do DIY projects, practice mindfulness, and watch documentaries."

  name: Alexander Litzenberger
  bio: "Hello, I am Alex. I am a Junior Double Major in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science. I spend my free time Reading (mostly Philosophy) books, and white water kayaking. I believe in objective truth but not certain knowledge so I think that we should strive to make the latter approximate the former. Fun fact, not a big fan of fiction books."
