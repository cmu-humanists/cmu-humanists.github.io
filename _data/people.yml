andy_norman:
  name: Andy Norman
  bio: "Andy Norman directs the Humanism Initiative at Carnegie Mellon University. He searches in vain for wisdom, but knows enough to enjoy a good sneeze. He finds perplexing questions endlessly entertaining. Frisbees and good conversations cause him to lose track of time. He’s done research on the evolutionary origins of human reasoning and the norms that make dialogue fruitful. His work has appeared in Free Inquiry, The Humanist, and dozens of refereed journals. He’s working on a book about how ideologies short-circuit thinking and corrupt moral understanding."

  name: Alex Fogelson
  bio: "Hey everyone, I'm Alex. I'm currently both an undergrad in Math and Computer Science, as well as a Master's student in Data Analytics. In my spare time, I like to read as much as I can, I go climbing indoors and outdoors, and ocassionally dabble in chess online. While I love the aesthetic of beard-stroking philosophy, I think ethics is the most important branch of philosophy to apply to one's everyday life."
