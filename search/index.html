Proponents also think that planned deaths can help improve quality of life by avoiding unnecessary suffering by the person committing suicide and by her loved ones. Opponents of assisted suicide think that it stigmatizes disability, and legitimizes death as a solution to problems. Opponents are also concerned that allowing assisted suicide creates more opportunities for people to pressure themselves or others into suicides for reasons the opponents think are illegitimate.Morally speaking, under what situations is it permissible, or even right, to commit suicide? For which of those situations is it permissible to help another commit suicide? Given that, what should be done, both personally and through government policy, in order to make sure that permissible suicides are allowed, and that other suicides are prevented?",

What does our definition of religion mean for atheism or agnosticism, and can they counted as a religion at all?Does classifying certain beliefs as religion give them legitimacy in the public eye or protect them from scrutiny? Such arguments have been made about Scientology, where some would argue it is a religion, while others say it is a cult. Should we be more harsh or more inclusive in our definition of religion, and what impacts may that have on how much power they control?Furthermore, why do we care? For legal purposes, what does and does not count as a religion can have big consequences. From tax exemption, to getting days off work, to being allowed to not have your children vaccinated, beliefs with the special status of religion can have far reaching impacts on our society and day to day life.",

Biologically or psychologically, the differences are immediately apparent: humans have unmatched language, rationality, adaptability, cooperation, and accomplishments. However, less obvious to many is the existence of a moral difference between humans and other animals.Many argue that humans are not morally distinct from animals because their physical differences, such as a higher brain mass to body mass ratio than those of other animals, do not warrant moral distinction. Others argue that these same physical differences result in significant differences in morally relevant qualities like consciousness or knowledge.On the spiritual side, some argue that spiritual qualities shared among all animals render even the most physically significant differences morally insignificant. Others believe that only humans are endowed with certain spiritual qualities, like souls, that make them morally distinct from animals.As you can see, a lot of disagreement on this question hinges on disagreements over what is morally significant. What is your criteria for determining moral significance? What is the value that your criteria leads you to place in animals? How does this value compare to the value that you place in humans?",

Can we dispense with questionable claims about supernatural agency and still help people connect with something larger than themselves?  What would that look like?  Are there real-world examples of this phenomenon?  Do they “work” for people?  Can a thoroughly naturalistic worldview satisfy people’s need for connection, meaning, and transcendence?

A world without suffering and illness, or poverty and greed, or a world where no has to work, or where all evil is eliminated. But perhaps Sir Thomas More was trying to tell us something about Utopia in the word he coined from the greek οὐ (“not”) and τόπος (“place”), and so Utopia means “no-place”. As the dystopian literature has shown us, a utopian vision could easily become twisted into dystopia if you’re not careful what you wish for. In many ways our ideas about utopias and dystopias tell us about the kind of world we live in and our cultural aspirations and fears, and we maybe we learn something from them that helps us move towards a real life utopia, if that is indeed something we should strive for.If you could construct the world to be how you think it should, what would it look like?

But when should being part of a group dictate your political decisions? Can a White working class American and a Transgender African American ever vote in the same way? We have seen an increase in the use of the phrase identity politics, especially in the last election, where both sides have been accused of pandering to certain groups to gain their votes. The left has been accused of using identity politics on topics such as race, gender, and sexuality to gain the votes of those who identify as part of those groups. While the right has been said to placate the rich, white, “working-class” and religious. If you identify with one of these groups you likely feel pressured to vote for the party that seems to support your group. Even if this means that the rest of the platform you are supporting wouldn’t be something you would choose.These identity informed politics often use tactics that abstract from the issues at hand, and polarize groups of people. This can become even more concerning when certain groups of people feel that they can not vote one way or another because their welfare is going to be at stake. Creating a “us versus them” mentality which creates more than political divides, but social, racial, and economic ones as well, and at that point may make us question the larger issues within our country rather than with the political parties. How do we move away from identities forming the basis of political parties and instead focus on critical debate and examination of the issues at play? At what point do political parties formed around identity groups rather than policy positions become an issue that prevents political progress?",

        "category": "discussions",
        "content": "In a capitalist system, people can earn large amounts of money in a variety of ways (both moral and immoral), and once they pay their taxes, they can use or retain it however they wish. The predominate view in such a system is that these people have a right to earn money through hard work, and many people extend this to a right to retain this money as well. But is it really moral to retain that money?The argument can be made, as it is in this article, that retaining wealth is inherently immoral due to the vast number of people suffering due to a lack of funds. The millions or billions of dollars spent on mansions or frivolous, unnecessary goods by people with wealth could be spent paying for houses for homeless people or opening a hospital with completely free medical care to save lives. Needless deaths and suffering could be prevented without meaningfully decreasing the wealthy person’s quality of life.Regardless of the means of acquiring wealth, is it immoral to retain wealth instead of helping others? Do we even have an obligation to help others and relieve their suffering? And finally, how much money could one retain before it would become immoral to have wealth?",

        "content": "As opportunities to decide what to want become more frequent, it becomes more necessary to fully develop a moral framework founded on objective principles with implications for what we should want. One field where we can find such principles is epistemology (the study of knowledge), from which we can get that we ought to want to be persuaded and to maintain our ability to be persuaded (as both individuals and societies), since being persuaded is how we manage to stop doing wrong things. We may also wish to take such principles as axioms, such as the principle that we should want beauty.This question cuts deep into the fundamentals of existence. What food should you want to eat? If this applies to most people, should they be coerced into wanting to eat that food? What principles and frameworks do you base your solutions on? What sexual orientation should you have? Should people be coerced into changing their sexual orientation to a better one (if this were possible)? Why? What should you want to do with your leisure time?

        "author": "",
        "category": "discussions",
        "content": "Almost everyone acts and justifies their actions based on the assumption that morality is worth following. The moral foundations people use to justify their actions and with which they plan out courses of action differ, but fundamentally most people have the intuition that some actions are right and others wrong.Where this runs into trouble is when people try to convince other people that their own morality is correct and the other person’s is wrong. In doing so, this action assumes that there is some external morality that both people should follow. To many people, though, it seems impossible to derive any moral statement from a fact about the universe.If morality is not objective — if it does not follow from a fact about the universe — another option is that it is subjective. In support of that, we can see that some parts of human morality appear to reflect the nature of humanity, and our fundamental moral beliefs can often be traced causally back to some step in human evolution. But at the same time many people have the intuition that, even if humans or human society had evolved differently, true morality would be the same.Can we reconcile these two competing intuitions, or must one be thrown out? Is morality fundamentally tied to human beliefs about it? Is there an objective morality?",

Raising children is seen as a long-term investment in both the community’s future and your own future. The moral choice to create children may be justified by the meaning it gives the parents through transformation of their identity onto the child, as well as by a right to create a lasting mark on the world.Meanwhile, the state of the world would indicate that having children is not beneficial to the general population. Overpopulation is detrimental to environmental conditions and to human health, and millions of orphaned children suffer worldwide. Given these factors, deciding to have children would seem to be simply an addition to the preexisting problem. However, there are a lot of worldwide problems that do not substantially change how we live our lives; few people care enough about worldwide water shortages to ensure they do not waste a single drop of water, so why would they worry about the contribution of a few kids to worldwide overpopulation?Is having children solely a personal decision? Do the benefits of having children outweigh the marginal increase in world population? Is there a moral obligation to or to not have children?",

        "category": "discussions",
        "content": "What is free will? One conception of free will is that it is the ability to have done otherwise. In other words, someone has free will if their choices are “free” – there is nothing biasing the choice towards one option or another. This means that there is no reason for the outcome of a choice other than that it was chosen, and that if time were “reset” back to a free choice, another option could be chosen.The other conception of free will that free will is being the cause or originator of one’s actions. This conception can be very similar to the previous one if free will requires being the first or only cause of one’s actions. However, it differs significantly if we allow decision makers to be deterministic. Under this conception, it is possible for a human in our society to have free will over how much she exercises; if free will requires being the first or only cause of action, then our hypothetical human does not have free will over her exercise because it is determined by her specific circumstances and the details of her upbringing.Our specific conception of free will often determines whether we think we have it. Many of those who conceive of free will in the first way believe that we do not have free will because free choice is incompatible with a deterministic (or even extant) universe.Determining whether we or others have free will is necessary because it is required by many conceptions of morality (for assigning responsibility or punishment) and meaning. How does free will fit in to your conception of morality? Can an action or state be wrong if it wasn’t chosen? Do moral agents necessarily have free will? Should we feel hurt or delighted by the actions of others if those others do not have free will?",

        "content": "Social justice fundamentally deals with an individual’s relation to society and whether individuals have a just standing in society. So naturally, we talk of social justice with regards to those in society who are worse off in some way as compared to others in society. We then think of those worse off as suffering a social injustice, as they do not have a similar standing to the rest of society.This seemingly simple idea is complicated when you start to discuss the ways individuals (or groups of individuals) have a worse off standing in society, and the solutions to such injustice are often even more difficult to agree on. Central to social justice is a desire for equality, sometimes referred to as fairness, in society. However, what should be equal among individuals in society? Should we should strive for equality of opportunity or outcomes? Perhaps it depends on the particular issue?These fundamental questions about what types of equality matter have profound implications in practice, as they will affect how society chooses to allocate its finite amount of resources to individuals. The fact that such resources are finite seems to imply that to equalize society you must lower some individuals’ statuses to improve others. But is this always the case? Will you have to infringe upon the freedoms of some individuals to gain equality? Conversely, does inequality mean society is infringing upon the freedoms of the less fortunate?Finally, there is the issue of who is in charge of equalizing society. Usually we think of this as being a job for the government, however, could other forces provide equality to society? For example, can a free market provide social equality? Ultimately, what is the best way to ensure social justice and in what areas of society should we have social justice?",

The act enfranchised millions of Americans and is widely regarded as the crowning achievement of the civil rights movement. And yet ﬁfty years later we are still ﬁghting heated battles over race, representation, and political power, with lawmakers devising new strategies to keep minorities out of the voting booth and the Supreme Court declaring a key part of the Voting Rights Act unconstitutional.",

        "content": "Politics has never been easy, however it seems to have been getting harder and harder in some ways, particularly in having constructive discourse between opposing viewpoints. Many have been left disheartened by the inability of our politicians to hold constructive debate and dialogue between each other, especially given the recent presidential campaign. However this isn’t simply an issue for politicians, as we all must at some points confront people with differing political opinions and ideas. Yet many have found it increasingly difficult to engage in any conversations even touching on politics with those of differing views and have instead chosen to avoid such conversations.To understand why political discourse seems to have deteriorated, many people point to the increasingly emotionally charged and vitriolic language used by politicians. However looking back through history, has such harsh language always been a part of politics? Perhaps even more concerning than the harsh tone of discourse is that the very style and manner of political rhetoric seems to be splitting between the two sides of the political spectrum. That means that often the content of what one says can matter less that the way in which the say it, since the two sides of the political spectrum have evolved distinct vocabulary that identify their speakers as belonging to a certain side. Thus speakers will often be labeled before they have even said anything substantive.What are the barriers hindering constructive political discourse? Is the rhetoric on opposite sides of the political spectrum becoming more split? Ultimately how do we best go about engaging in constructive political discourse? What responsibility do we have as citizens to engage with others constructively over political matters?",

        "content": "In today’s society, education is valued to a certain extent. Primary and secondary education is mandated for all by law, ensuring every US citizen goes to school for at least twelve years of their life. However, why is this mandated? What purpose of education is so necessary that we force every individual to learn? Many claim that education is essential for being a citizen of a democracy. Others say education helps prepare individuals to enter the workforce. Still others say that the purpose of education should be to better ourselves.What we take to be the goal of education is immensely important as it not only affects what we teach, how we teach it, and who we teach it to, but it also affects the very nature of society and the world we live in. So what is the purpose of education? How well does our current education system address that purpose? How can we improve education? What are the challenges involved in educating people?",

        "author": "",
        "category": "discussions",
        "content": "Implicit biases are unconscious effects that cause errors in our thinking. The negative effects of these errors are quite apparent in our thinking about other people – they contribute to pernicious structural racism and sexism. Thus it is in our interest to create and implement practicable methods to counteract these biases.In order for these biases to cause errors in our thinking, two conditions must be met (according to dual process theory). First, our unconscious minds have to make an error. Then our conscious minds have to accept that error. One strategy for combating bias is to prevent the first step by disconnecting our unconscious minds from information they erroneously assign significance to. This is what Google does in its hiring process by withholding demographic information from hirers. Another strategy is to train our conscious minds to detect and correct the errors made by our unconscious minds. Psychological research has shown that merely being made aware of our biases can reduce the severity of the bias in our decisions.What strategies or tactics for combating implicit bias have come across in your life? How would you detect the magnitude of your own biases? How might you try to correct these biases once you have detected them? How might you gauge the impact of your attempts? And how might you maintain and improve your methods to do these things in the future?",

        "category": "discussions",
        "content": "When considering the morality of an action, one often considers the impact it will have on the affected beings. These beings would be considered morally significant if the effect of an action on them changes the morality of the action. Although the action is discussed most often, the moral significance of the affected being can play a deterministic role in the action’s morality. Burning a piece of paper is less morally wrong than burning a human. Moral significance seems to be less apparent, however, when considering differences between a tree, a dog, and a human.What differentiates the beings we consider morally significant, versus those we consider okay to harm? Is it consciousness? Is it the ability to think and consider options rationally? If so, what about humans that are mentally disabled? Are humans intrinsically morally significant, regardless of all other attributes? If so, why? Can a person lose moral significance? What qualifies a being for moral significance?",

Jackson, and not Nick Fury, Denzel Washington, or LaTanya Richardson. The question is, how do we define that identity? The criteria for identity is more elusive than it might first appear – the obvious criteria often changes depending on what you are trying to differentiate between at the moment.More broadly, what makes the government of Pennsylvania the government of Pennsylvania? Or a bag of cookies in Entropy THAT bag and not the bag immediately to its left? What makes you you and not someone else? What is it that makes Hillary Clinton at 25 and Hillary Clinton at 45 both Hillary Clinton (née Rodham)?If you want more information (it’s not at all necessary for the meeting), you can watch a video on identity here.",
