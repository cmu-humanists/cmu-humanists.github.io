        "category": "discussions",
        "content": "Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances that alter one’s mental state, often leading to altered perceptions, moods, and behaviors. Some psychoactive drugs include Psilocybin Mushrooms, Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD), Cannabis, Tobacco, MDMA, Benadryl, Zyban, and Alcohol. The effects of psychoactive substance vary dramatically, from only mild highs, to completely altering an individual’s personality and grasp on reality. Many of these drugs are regulated, ranging from making the substance completely illegal to manufacture, sell, and posses, to requiring a prescription to obtain, to simply needing to be over 18 to purchase. However many disagree with the way in which governments regulate psychoactive substance, often criticizing the arbitrary nature with which seemingly harmless drugs are prohibited while very harmful drugs are allowed to be prescribed. This leads to the question of how we know what drugs are considered harmful?Many psychoactive substances in fact have a long histories of being consumed by humans for various purposes. A prominent historical usage of psychoactive substances has been for spiritual reasons as the altered mind state of some substances seems to lead many to experiences that they describe as profoundly meaningful and feeling a connection with the world around them that they doesn’t usually feel. Furthermore we see that many psychoactive substances do in fact have legitimate medical usages as we see many pharmaceutical companies manufacturing various medications containing psychoactive substances.How can we decide what psychoactive substances should be allowable and what should be prohibited? How can illicit substances be effectively prohibited? What are legitimate reasons for consumption of psychoactive substances?",

        "content": "The Me Too movement (or “#MeToo”) is a hashtag used to express solidarity in experiencing sexual assault and to demonstrate the prevalence of sexual misconduct in modern society. The phrase was previously used in this context by Tarana Burke in 2006 and was popularized by Alyssa Milano in October 2017.Since then, the phrase, usually with an accompanying personal story, has been shared online millions of times all around the world, in multiple languages and with a variety of spinoffs for unique subgroups. High-profile celebrities have come forth with their personal stories such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Ashley Judd, Jennifer Lawrence, Uma Thurman, and Terry Crews. It has also brought to light allegations against Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, and Louis C. K.#MeToo has reached a critical point where social scientists are suggesting it is capable of changing culture. Multiple men have resigned in light of allegations against them. Policies around sexual harassment and rape kits have been updated in schools, military, and government. Greater emphasis has been placed on the importance reporting abuse, especially among male peers. Traditional gender norms around sexual behavior and consent have been challenged.What other ways has the #MeToo movement impacted culture? How has this phenomena impacted you? Where do you see this movement going in the future? Why do you think it has taken this long for it to have happened?The Wikipedia page has a pretty comprehensive #MeToo summaryThe Chicago Tribune’s visual timeline of events around #MeToo",

        "content": "Toxic Masculinity refers to pressure applied against men by themselves or others to fulfill harmful male gender roles, such as dominance, social and sexual aggression, emotional invulnerability, and complete self-reliance.Pressure to perform in these roles causes direct harm to men and indirect harm to the those around them. For example, toxic masculinity directly harms men by pressuring them to refuse or avoid social support in an attempt to appear emotionally invulnerable, which has been shown to increase their rate of completing suicide. Toxic masculinity indirectly harms those around men by pressuring them to use violence against others even when they don’t want to.One specific example of a toxic masculine ideal is the perception that it is shameful or unbecoming of a man to do housework. This is a source of household difficulties in patriarchies everywhere, where women are saddled with disproportionate amounts of housework and men feel like they don’t have control over their own living spaces. An extreme example of this can be found in traditional Italian culture, where men often feel like they are forced to depend on women even when they want to live independently. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/apr/06/italy.sophiearieHow has toxic masculinity impacted you? How do we differentiate between what is toxically masculine and what is merely masculine? What can men do to oppose or decrease the affect of toxic masculinity on themselves? What individual and societal changes should we make to decrease  the pressure on men to conform to male gender roles? How does the impact and form of toxic masculinity change across cultures and regions?",

But in certain situations many of us feel obligated to behave altruistically, such as when someone with their hands full needs to go through a doorway, or when a community is struck by a devastating natural disaster. When is being altruistic something that we ought to do instead of being something that is merely good to do? Under what conditions should other people switch from behaving selfishly to behaving altruistically? Do those conditions depend on the need of others and the extent of our abilities? How do we compare our own needs to those of others? Do the conditions change for small groups, like fellowships? What about large or highly organized groups, like states and religions?As an individual, how much should you try to help out other individuals? How much should you spend on supporting groups?

Some parts of the world still use chalk boards and paper administration, and confiscate electronics if they are visible in the classroom. Other parts of the world attend class virtually, watch videos of their professors at any hour of the day, and complete assignments and exams through secure online servers. Some are caught somewhere in between, completing polls on their phone in class, or taking notes on their computer.Additionally, secondary education is changing also. While “trade schools” are still popular and produce technicians and engineers, the blue class workers are increasingly moving towards office work. No longer risking their lives in the field, they are now programming the robots which go into the fields. This suggests a dramatic shift in employment opportunities for the working class.That leaves us with many uncertainties for all levels of education. What will school look like for young children? What will high school look like for future employees? What will secondary education look like for blue and white collar fields? What we do know is that more information is being made accessible to larger swaths of people, and for free. What we don’t know is, what will the future of education look like?Here are some links to some things to consider as education changes (or doesn’t change) in the future:9 Things That Will Shape The Future Of Education: What Learning Will Look Like In 20 Years?6 Problems with our School System",

        "title": "The Morality of Porn",
        "author": "",
        "category": "discussions",
        "content": "The morality of porn is a contentious topic for a variety of reasons. Porn production, religious beliefs, and perceived positive or negative effects on oneself or others (among other reasons) can all play a role in personal and philosophical positions on whether porn is good or bad.Porn production is often a significant consideration when people discuss whether the existence of porn (as opposed to its consumption) is moral. Porn actors have been exploited in the creation of some films in the form of exploitation and misinformation, and some films may be produced illegally. For example, an actor may have been told that she had to perform a certain sexual act, or been told that a sexual act would not be damaging when it would actually cause severe physical damage. Rosebudding, also known as anal prolapse in the medical world, is an unfortunate example of a growing porn trend that causes/requires physical damage for an actor to perform. Ethical porn is also available where the directors put ethical production and treatment of the actors at the focus of their business.Besides the production, many people take stances on porn based on its perceived effects, with varying levels of evidence. Potential benefits include sexual pleasure, control over their own sexuality, sex education, increased exploration by themselves or with partners, better relationships, and greater sexual satisfaction. Potential negative effects include porn-induced erectile dysfunction, porn addiction, worsened body image, lessened attraction to partners, and lessened desire to have sex. In the case of children, many people also worry that exposure to porn can upset sexual or emotional development and ideas of how sex and relationships should develop. Religion is a common principled objection to the viewing of porn, with various mainstream religions taking a stance that porn and masturbation are morally wrong.Is it unethical for pornographic films with (sometimes severe) risks to actors to be produced? What about if the actor knew the risks beforehand? Is it unethical to view these films? Does ethical porn fix the problem? Do the potential effects on children matter to our general consumption? Do other porn mediums (written erotica, pictures, audio) have a different moral standard? How do religious beliefs affect the moral stance on porn? Do the potential benefits or detriments allow us to make a general moral judgement on porn?",

        "content": "The art market is currently booming. Last November the record for the most expensive painting ever sold at auction was shattered by Leonardo da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi” selling for $450.3 Million. However increasingly many of these great works of art go right into storage as their buyers see them as sound investments that will appreciate in value rather than masterpieces to be appreciated for their beauty. Although many great works of art hang in private collections, at least they are gazed upon by some humans, which leads to the question, does putting art in a box as in investment defeat the point of the art?And what about the artists? How should they feel about their life’s work going unappreciated in a warehouse somewhere? Yet one may argue that art being seen as also an investment opportunity brings more money to artists and enables more artists to make a living. To complicate things even further, often those paying big dollars for pieces of artwork did not come by their money in very ethical ways and art provides a convenient way for them to launder their money. Should artists consider these issues when selling their work?Is it immoral for art masterpieces to go unappreciated? Should we regulate the art market to prevent this and other issues? Should artists consider to who and how sell their work? The answer to these questions seems to depend on the answer to the more general question: what is the purpose of the art anyway?",

Should the goals of parenting reflect the type of society or country we are in? For example, should one of the goals of parenting be to encourage children to follow their dreams, or to work hard and be a doctor because that will be the best choice for society? Who should get to decide the goals of parenting, and will they be flexible enough to encompass a large variety of beliefs and backgrounds without being western ideals, or christian ideals etc?

Social anarchists advocate the conversion of present-day private property into social property or the commons, while still retaining a respect for personal property.The term “social anarchism” is often used interchangeably with libertarian socialism, left-libertarianism, or left anarchism. It emerged in the late 19th century as a distinction from individualist anarchism.What do you think of social anarchy? Can a social anarchist society viably exist?

        "category": "discussions",
        "content": "The vast majority of societies have had laws of some nature, indicating that humans generally find them necessary to the operation of a society. In some cases, these laws have been for the benefit of those they govern, like property laws, and in other cases, they’ve been to the detriment, like laws forbidding American slaves to learn to read. Laws have also been based on a number of different structures. Some laws attempt to prevent concentrations of power and attempt to distribute power throughout groups of people. Others create laws from perceived rights, like the right to free speech. And different governments have also had different methods of revising laws; some forbid the governed from advocating for better laws, while others welcome the criticism to attempt to create a more equal society.In modern society as in historical societies, laws cover a wide range of topics. In the United States, some examples of laws are those against killing, smoking marijuana, walking around naked in public, drinking alcohol under the age of 21, stealing, invading privacy, and carrying a firearm without a permit. People differ in their opinions of the validity of some of these laws, and the purpose behind the law is not clear in all cases.So, what is the purpose of laws? To protect people from each other, from the government, or from themselves? To improve lives or control lives? Something else? What can the purpose of laws tell us about the validity of our current laws?",

        "content": "Utilitarianism is a consequentialist moral theory, meaning the core to determining what is right and wrong depends on the effects of each action we take. Utilitarians believe that the purpose of morality is to make life better by increasing the amount of good things (which can be things like pleasure or happiness), and decreasing the amount of bad, (such as pain and unhappiness).Within utilitarianism there are usually two distinctions made, between act and rule. Rule utilitarianism says that we can produce more beneficial results by following rules than by always performing individual actions whose results are as beneficial as possible. This suggests that we should not always perform individual actions that maximize utility, but instead always stay in accordance with our pre-determined rules. Act utilitarianism says that if our aim is always to produce the best results, that in each case of deciding what is the right thing to do, we should consider the available options, predict their outcomes, and approve of the action that will produce the most good.While utilitarianism is seemingly a straight forward, relying on the simple principle, do what produces the most good, it has many complexities. For instance, what is good? Do we simply measure it by what produces the most pleasure, happiness? What is happiness, how can we measure it? What are the systems or algorithms we can use to determine what options there are? What mechanism can we use to weigh these options, and make choices about them within a reasonable amount of time? These questions among others keeps the conversations open for utilitarianism as a viable system of morality.",

One of the more recent examples can be found in the case, Fisher vs. University of Texas at Austin, in which Abigail Fisher sued the university claiming it was not granting her admission because she is Caucasian.Those who argue for affirmative action claim that it accounts for the additional layers of difficulty that racial/ethnic minorities and women face due to their identity. Additionally, proponents say that it corrects the disproportionate percentages of these groups in schools and industries that has come about from extreme inequality historically. Even though discriminatory actions have now become illegal against these groups, supporters say, they still face social discrimination and the impact of past discrimination is still very prominent and has yet to be corrected. They believe one way to correct such a thing is through affirmative action.However, those who do not support affirmative action say that society should not be focusing on race or gender when admitting people into a certain school or workplace because it creates unnecessary tension. Instead of taking account these different identities, we should not “see” color or gender when interacting with other people in order to attain true equality. Adversaries also claim that it is reverse discrimination and that one should be admitted based only on merit, not for their race or gender.Many universities, including Carnegie Mellon, have incorporated affirmative action into their admission process. Last year’s SCS and CIT freshman class set new records for percentage of women admitted- 48.5% and 43.3%, respectively. School officials, such as Michael Steidel and Jelena Kovačević, seem to have spoken optimistically about the results, whereas some students have expressed discontentment with the university’s decision.So, should affirmative action stay or be eliminated? What are the pros and cons of keeping affirmative action? If it should stay, are there cases where affirmative action is not appropriate?",

Only 13 years ago was Facebook started and today over a quarter of the world population is on the platform. Social media has impacted the way in which we connect and communicate with each other. But is this change for the better or worse? We’ve seen social media be used to overthrow governments during the Arab spring. During the last US presidential campaign we saw the spread of fake news over social media, ultimately swaying the outcome of the election. We’ve seen social media phenomena raise awareness for issues that otherwise would not have had such widespread attention from the ice bucket challenge raising awareness for ALS to #MeToo raising awareness for sexism against women. We’ve also seen social media platforms enable the rise of cyber-bulling and hate speech against individuals, even leading some to commit suicide.Ultimately social media platforms are created and run by business who have an incentive to engage as many users for as much time as they can. This leads them to undertake seemingly good causes like bringing the infrastructure for the internet to countries and regions and can’t afford them. However it also leads them to make their platforms incredibly addictive, one side effect being that we get shown only the content we want to see.Do social media companies have a moral responsibility to make their platforms vehicles for social good? What happens when their business incentives are at odds with morality? Are social media platforms simply a tool so it is we, as users of social media, that have a moral responsibility to use them for good?

Biologically or psychologically, the differences are immediately apparent: humans have unmatched language, rationality, adaptability, cooperation, and accomplishments.

Others argue that these same physical differences result in significant differences in morally relevant qualities like consciousness or knowledge.On the spiritual side, some argue that spiritual qualities shared among all animals render even the most physically significant differences morally insignificant. Others believe that only humans are endowed with certain spiritual qualities, like souls, that make them morally distinct from animals.As you can see, a lot of disagreement on this question hinges on disagreements over what is morally significant.

Needless deaths and suffering could be prevented without meaningfully decreasing the wealthy person’s quality of life.Regardless of the means of acquiring wealth, is it immoral to retain wealth instead of helping others?

The moral foundations people use to justify their actions and with which they plan out courses of action differ, but fundamentally most people have the intuition that some actions are right and others wrong.Where this runs into trouble is when people try to convince other people that their own morality is correct and the other person’s is wrong. In doing so, this action assumes that there is some external morality that both people should follow. To many people, though, it seems impossible to derive any moral statement from a fact about the universe.If morality is not objective — if it does not follow from a fact about the universe — another option is that it is subjective. In support of that, we can see that some parts of human morality appear to reflect the nature of humanity, and our fundamental moral beliefs can often be traced causally back to some step in human evolution. But at the same time many people have the intuition that, even if humans or human society had evolved differently, true morality would be the same.Can we reconcile these two competing intuitions, or must one be thrown out? Is morality fundamentally tied to human beliefs about it? Is there an objective morality?",

Raising children is seen as a long-term investment in both the community’s future and your own future. The moral choice to create children may be justified by the meaning it gives the parents through transformation of their identity onto the child, as well as by a right to create a lasting mark on the world.Meanwhile, the state of the world would indicate that having children is not beneficial to the general population. Overpopulation is detrimental to environmental conditions and to human health, and millions of orphaned children suffer worldwide. Given these factors, deciding to have children would seem to be simply an addition to the preexisting problem. However, there are a lot of worldwide problems that do not substantially change how we live our lives; few people care enough about worldwide water shortages to ensure they do not waste a single drop of water, so why would they worry about the contribution of a few kids to worldwide overpopulation?Is having children solely a personal decision? Do the benefits of having children outweigh the marginal increase in world population? Is there a moral obligation to or to not have children?",

        "content": "What is free will? One conception of free will is that it is the ability to have done otherwise. In other words, someone has free will if their choices are “free” – there is nothing biasing the choice towards one option or another. This means that there is no reason for the outcome of a choice other than that it was chosen, and that if time were “reset” back to a free choice, another option could be chosen.The other conception of free will that free will is being the cause or originator of one’s actions. This conception can be very similar to the previous one if free will requires being the first or only cause of one’s actions. However, it differs significantly if we allow decision makers to be deterministic. Under this conception, it is possible for a human in our society to have free will over how much she exercises; if free will requires being the first or only cause of action, then our hypothetical human does not have free will over her exercise because it is determined by her specific circumstances and the details of her upbringing.Our specific conception of free will often determines whether we think we have it. Many of those who conceive of free will in the first way believe that we do not have free will because free choice is incompatible with a deterministic (or even extant) universe.Determining whether we or others have free will is necessary because it is required by many conceptions of morality (for assigning responsibility or punishment) and meaning. How does free will fit in to your conception of morality? Can an action or state be wrong if it wasn’t chosen? Do moral agents necessarily have free will? Should we feel hurt or delighted by the actions of others if those others do not have free will?",

So naturally, we talk of social justice with regards to those in society who are worse off in some way as compared to others in society. We then think of those worse off as suffering a social injustice, as they do not have a similar standing to the rest of society.This seemingly simple idea is complicated when you start to discuss the ways individuals (or groups of individuals) have a worse off standing in society, and the solutions to such injustice are often even more difficult to agree on. Central to social justice is a desire for equality, sometimes referred to as fairness, in society. However, what should be equal among individuals in society? Should we should strive for equality of opportunity or outcomes? Perhaps it depends on the particular issue?These fundamental questions about what types of equality matter have profound implications in practice, as they will affect how society chooses to allocate its finite amount of resources to individuals. The fact that such resources are finite seems to imply that to equalize society you must lower some individuals’ statuses to improve others. But is this always the case? Will you have to infringe upon the freedoms of some individuals to gain equality? Conversely, does inequality mean society is infringing upon the freedoms of the less fortunate?Finally, there is the issue of who is in charge of equalizing society. Usually we think of this as being a job for the government, however, could other forces provide equality to society? For example, can a free market provide social equality? Ultimately, what is the best way to ensure social justice and in what areas of society should we have social justice?",

Many have been left disheartened by the inability of our politicians to hold constructive debate and dialogue between each other, especially given the recent presidential campaign. However this isn’t simply an issue for politicians, as we all must at some points confront people with differing political opinions and ideas. Yet many have found it increasingly difficult to engage in any conversations even touching on politics with those of differing views and have instead chosen to avoid such conversations.To understand why political discourse seems to have deteriorated, many people point to the increasingly emotionally charged and vitriolic language used by politicians. However looking back through history, has such harsh language always been a part of politics? Perhaps even more concerning than the harsh tone of discourse is that the very style and manner of political rhetoric seems to be splitting between the two sides of the political spectrum. That means that often the content of what one says can matter less that the way in which the say it, since the two sides of the political spectrum have evolved distinct vocabulary that identify their speakers as belonging to a certain side. Thus speakers will often be labeled before they have even said anything substantive.What are the barriers hindering constructive political discourse? Is the rhetoric on opposite sides of the political spectrum becoming more split? Ultimately how do we best go about engaging in constructive political discourse?

The negative effects of these errors are quite apparent in our thinking about other people – they contribute to pernicious structural racism and sexism. Thus it is in our interest to create and implement practicable methods to counteract these biases.In order for these biases to cause errors in our thinking, two conditions must be met (according to dual process theory). First, our unconscious minds have to make an error. Then our conscious minds have to accept that error. One strategy for combating bias is to prevent the first step by disconnecting our unconscious minds from information they erroneously assign significance to. This is what Google does in its hiring process by withholding demographic information from hirers. Another strategy is to train our conscious minds to detect and correct the errors made by our unconscious minds. Psychological research has shown that merely being made aware of our biases can reduce the severity of the bias in our decisions.What strategies or tactics for combating implicit bias have come across in your life? How would you detect the magnitude of your own biases? How might you try to correct these biases once you have detected them? How might you gauge the impact of your attempts?

Third, it provides incentive for the powers that be to align its interests with those of the populace.However, democracy relies on educated public paying attention to the right things and making the right decisions.

Another view is that violence is the result of various cultural and political factors which have little to do with religious doctrine.How and why does fundamentalism grip people’s beliefs, when the world is naturally diverse in opinions?

On the other hand, it seems like having a job and working confers some sort of satisfaction that one’s life matters and makes a difference. But should we really derive meaning from our jobs?When we examine the modern attitude towards work, we see that many of our values surrounding work come from the industrial revolution and the rise of a ‘working class’. But do these values, created for a population that mostly worked on factory assembly lines, serve us in a technologicaly based economy? For example, is money really the best incentive to get people to be more productive?Finally, as we look towards the future, will work become obsolete as the world moves increasingly towards automation in many sectors of the economy? If so, what will people do with their time, and where will people find meaning in their lives?

Is there anything inherently wrong with modifying our own bodies and brains? What if parents could make that choice for their children?

However, James Croft believes that Carl Sagan’s approach to science was embedded within an ethical and existential framework that can best be described as “spiritual”. One which holds a sense of possibility, of wonder of the magnitude of not just the universe, but of the human potential to make meaning within it.How can a scientific worldview be spiritual, if at all?

Unfortunately, we as individuals don’t often live up to that ideal – even scientists aren’t perfect at changing their minds, and can be as bad as the rest of us once they leave the lab. This talk will explain Bayesianism as a theory of how one should change one’s mind in response to new evidence, and discuss its uses and limitations in real life. We’ll also explore the science behind why we’re so resistant to changing our minds, and some promising techniques that might help us “un-stick” our opinions when they’re stuck.  Julia Galef is the President and Founder of the Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR), a nonprofit think tank based in Berkeley, CA.  CFR is devoted to developing, testing, and training people in reasoning and decision making strategies. It turns insights from decision theory, math, and cognitive science into simple mental habits that help with making more accurate predictions, avoiding rationalizations, following through on plans, and other such skills.",
