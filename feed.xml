These are often described as stateless societies, or non-hierarchical associations as opposed to institutions. Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While social anarchism is just one of many branches of anarchist theory, it emphasizes mutual aid, community decision making, and individual equality. Social anarchists advocate the conversion of present-day private property into social property or the commons, while still retaining a respect for personal property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “social anarchism” is often used interchangeably with libertarian socialism, left-libertarianism, or left anarchism. It emerged in the late 19th century as a distinction from individualist anarchism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think of social anarchy? Can a social anarchist society viably exist? Would you support communal ownership over private ownership? Would you want to live in an anarchist community?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="discussions" /><category term="anarchy" /><category term="society" /><summary type="html">Social anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates self-governed societies based on voluntary institutions.

In some cases, these laws have been for the benefit of those they govern, like property laws, and in other cases, they’ve been to the detriment, like laws forbidding American slaves to learn to read. Laws have also been based on a number of different structures. Some laws attempt to prevent concentrations of power and attempt to distribute power throughout groups of people. Others create laws from perceived rights, like the right to free speech. And different governments have also had different methods of revising laws; some forbid the governed from advocating for better laws, while others welcome the criticism to attempt to create a more equal society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In modern society as in historical societies, laws cover a wide range of topics. In the United States, some examples of laws are those against killing, smoking marijuana, walking around naked in public, drinking alcohol under the age of 21, stealing, invading privacy, and carrying a firearm without a permit. People differ in their opinions of the validity of some of these laws, and the purpose behind the law is not clear in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is the purpose of laws? To protect people from each other, from the government, or from themselves? To improve lives or control lives? Something else? What can the purpose of laws tell us about the validity of our current laws?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="discussions" /><category term="laws" /><category term="society" /><summary type="html">The vast majority of societies have had laws of some nature, indicating that humans generally find them necessary to the operation of a society.

Utilitarians believe that the purpose of morality is to make life better by increasing the amount of good things (which can be things like pleasure or happiness), and decreasing the amount of bad, (such as pain and unhappiness).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within utilitarianism there are usually two distinctions made, between act and rule. Rule utilitarianism says that we can produce more beneficial results by following rules than by always performing individual actions whose results are as beneficial as possible. This suggests that we should not always perform individual actions that maximize utility, but instead always stay in accordance with our pre-determined rules. Act utilitarianism says that if our aim is always to produce the best results, that in each case of deciding what is the right thing to do, we should consider the available options, predict their outcomes, and approve of the action that will produce the most good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While utilitarianism is seemingly a straight forward, relying on the simple principle, do what produces the most good, it has many complexities. For instance, what is good? Do we simply measure it by what produces the most pleasure, happiness? What is happiness, how can we measure it? What are the systems or algorithms we can use to determine what options there are? What mechanism can we use to weigh these options, and make choices about them within a reasonable amount of time? These questions among others keeps the conversations open for utilitarianism as a viable system of morality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="discussions" /><category term="utilitarianism" /><category term="morality" /><summary type="html">Utilitarianism is a consequentialist moral theory, meaning the core to determining what is right and wrong depends on the effects of each action we take.

&lt;p&gt;It would cost the government $1.5 trillion to distribute $10 billion to only children and US citizens earning less than $100,000 annual (74% of the population makes less than $100,000).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arguments for UBI include equitable and fair distribution of technological advancements; for example it may eliminate poverty and result in explosive growth in creativity, entrepreneurship, and research. While the arguments against UBI include elimination of incentives for production and work, inability of some countries to distribute funds, and global inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think about UBI? If you agree with it, how much is fair? What are some of the downsides you could imagine from it? Whose responsibility is it to provide UBI? Who would benefit? Would you want UBI? If you did, what would you do with your life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us on Tuesday November 7th for Carl Sagan Fest, our annual celebration of science and human values! This year, the internationally renowned biologist and public intellectual Richard Dawkins will receive the CMU Humanism Initiative’s Carl Sagan Award. The CMU community will have a chance to hear from one of the most influential thinkers of our time while we celebrate the spirit of inquiry that animated the late Professor Sagan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be free apple pie afterwards in Rangos 3!
After all, as Carl Sagan said, “&lt;em&gt;If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
