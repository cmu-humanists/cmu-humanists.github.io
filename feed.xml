&lt;p&gt;In our last email we sent out a poll for the next meeting topic and the results are in! At our next meeting this Monday, we will have a post Dawkins Unplugged discussion. We can discuss anything and everything regarding what Richard Dawkins talked about on Tuesday during Carl Sagan Fest. Dawkins’ shared his thoughts on a wide variety topics, such as the selfish gene, labeling children, scientific morality, vegetarianism and pain. Did you agree with what Dawkins had to say? What questions were you left with?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="discussions" /><category term="Carl Sagan Fest" /><category term="Dawkins" /><summary type="html">Thanks to everyone who came to Carl Sagan Fest 2017 featuring Richard Dawkins!

&lt;p&gt;Join us on Tuesday November 7th for Carl Sagan Fest, our annual celebration of science and human values! This year, the internationally renowned biologist and public intellectual Richard Dawkins will receive the CMU Humanism Initiative’s Carl Sagan Award. The CMU community will have a chance to hear from one of the most influential thinkers of our time while we celebrate the spirit of inquiry that animated the late Professor Sagan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be free apple pie afterwards in Rangos 3!
After all, as Carl Sagan said, “&lt;em&gt;If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

One of the more recent examples can be found in the case, Fisher vs. University of Texas at Austin, in which Abigail Fisher sued the university claiming it was not granting her admission because she is Caucasian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who argue for affirmative action claim that it accounts for the additional layers of difficulty that racial/ethnic minorities and women face due to their identity. Additionally, proponents say that it corrects the disproportionate percentages of these groups in schools and industries that has come about from extreme inequality historically. Even though discriminatory actions have now become illegal against these groups, supporters say, they still face social discrimination and the impact of past discrimination is still very prominent and has yet to be corrected. They believe one way to correct such a thing is through affirmative action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, those who do not support affirmative action say that society should not be focusing on race or gender when admitting people into a certain school or workplace because it creates unnecessary tension. Instead of taking account these different identities, we should not “see” color or gender when interacting with other people in order to attain true equality. Adversaries also claim that it is reverse discrimination and that one should be admitted based only on merit, not for their race or gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many universities, including Carnegie Mellon, have incorporated affirmative action into their admission process. Last year’s SCS and CIT freshman class set new records for percentage of women admitted- 48.5% and 43.3%, respectively. School officials, such as Michael Steidel and Jelena Kovačević, seem to have spoken optimistically about the results, whereas some students have expressed discontentment with the university’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, should affirmative action stay or be eliminated? What are the pros and cons of keeping affirmative action? If it should stay, are there cases where affirmative action is not appropriate?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="discussions" /><category term="society" /><category term="racism" /><summary type="html">Affirmative action has become increasingly more controversial over the past couple decades.

Only 13 years ago was Facebook started and today over a quarter of the world population is on the platform. Social media has impacted the way in which we connect and communicate with each other. But is this change for the better or worse? We’ve seen social media be used to overthrow governments during the Arab spring. During the last US presidential campaign we saw the spread of fake news over social media, ultimately swaying the outcome of the election. We’ve seen social media phenomena raise awareness for issues that otherwise would not have had such widespread attention from the ice bucket challenge raising awareness for ALS to #MeToo raising awareness for sexism against women. We’ve also seen social media platforms enable the rise of cyber-bulling and hate speech against individuals, even leading some to commit suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately social media platforms are created and run by business who have an incentive to engage as many users for as much time as they can. This leads them to undertake seemingly good causes like bringing the infrastructure for the internet to countries and regions and can’t afford them. However it also leads them to make their platforms incredibly addictive, one side effect being that we get shown only the content we want to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do social media companies have a moral responsibility to make their platforms vehicles for social good? What happens when their business incentives are at odds with morality? Are social media platforms simply a tool so it is we, as users of social media, that have a moral responsibility to use them for good? How can we make social media a force for good, or is that even possible?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="discussions" /><category term="ethics" /><category term="morality" /><category term="social media" /><summary type="html">The past decade has seen the rise of social media on an unprecedented scale.
