## Climate Change: Where we are and what we can do about it

This Thursday, the day after the International Earth Day, the Humanist League is hosting a speaker event, where **Neil Donahue, Lord Professor of Chemistry and Director of Steinbrenner Institute**, will speak on the current state of global climate change and our role in the planet's fate. **Ryan Brill from Sustainable Earth** will present ways in which people may commit to curbing climate change. We will also display a piece of art made collaboratively by the CMU community on a sustainable future.
