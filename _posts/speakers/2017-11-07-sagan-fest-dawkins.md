Join us on Tuesday November 7th for Carl Sagan Fest, our annual celebration of science and human values! This year, the internationally renowned biologist and public intellectual Richard Dawkins will receive the CMU Humanism Initiativeâ€™s Carl Sagan Award. The CMU community will have a chance to hear from one of the most influential thinkers of our time while we celebrate the spirit of inquiry that animated the late Professor Sagan.

There will be free apple pie afterwards in Rangos 3!
After all, as Carl Sagan said, "*If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.*"
