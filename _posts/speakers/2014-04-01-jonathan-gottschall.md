Jointly with Aha!, the Humanist League presents **The Science of Fiction** - *how stories make us human*, a talk by author and scholar Jonathan Gottschall. This Tuesday, instead of a discussion, we will be meeting 5pm at 136A Adamson Wing, CMU Baker Hall to learn how humans shape stories, and how stories shape us.
