## A talk by Chip Walter, and an award for Humanist League

The annual Darwin Day is here. We invited journalist and author, Chip Walter, to give a talk on human evolution and its importance to us today. We are also receiving the **University Award for Philosophical Diversity** from the American Humanist Association. Pizza, cupcakes and drinks will be served.

**Chip Walter**, author of international bestseller *Last Ape Standing*, explores how a creature as remarkable and strange as a human being came into existence, and why it matters. Is it possible to address the issues we face in the world today if we donâ€™t first investigate the roots of why we do, feel and think the things we do?
