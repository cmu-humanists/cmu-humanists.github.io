## Purgatory, Karma, digitised consciousness, or nothing...

Abrahamic religions hold that the afterlife consists of a Heaven, a Hell, and a Purgatory. Eastern religions believe in a cycle of karmic reincarnation. Ancient mythologies maintained that there exists a god that rules an underworld, or that some humans became gods in death, or that some humans were gods trapped on Earth, to be released by death.
