## Can you "waive" your right to life?

As [Canada overturns its ban on euthanasia](http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0206/678369-canada-euthanasia/), how can we deal with the moral quandary of "assisted suicide"? Does pain and suffering justify the termination of life? Should a patient's family and doctor respect his/her wish to die? What kinds of slippery slopes are presented by such a practice? How valid are they?
