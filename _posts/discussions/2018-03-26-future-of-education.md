Due to the incredible changes in technology during this "age of information", the Future of Education is uncertain. Some parts of the world still use chalk boards and paper administration, and confiscate electronics if they are visible in the classroom. Other parts of the world attend class virtually, watch videos of their professors at any hour of the day, and complete assignments and exams through secure online servers. Some are caught somewhere in between, completing polls on their phone in class, or taking notes on their computer.

Additionally, secondary education is changing also. While "trade schools" are still popular and produce technicians and engineers, the blue class workers are increasingly moving towards office work. No longer risking their lives in the field, they are now programming the robots which go into the fields. This suggests a dramatic shift in employment opportunities for the working class.

That leaves us with many uncertainties for all levels of education. What will school look like for young children? What will high school look like for future employees? What will secondary education look like for blue and white collar fields? What we do know is that more information is being made accessible to larger swaths of people, and for free. What we don't know is, what will the future of education look like?

Here are some links to some things to consider as education changes (or doesn't change) in the future:
