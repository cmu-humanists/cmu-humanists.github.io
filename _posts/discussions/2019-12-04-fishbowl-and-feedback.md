We're having our final Humanist League meeting of the year. Half the meeting will consist of fishbowl topics: suggestions from the audience that will be discussed for a shorter time. Half the meeting will consist of feedback, on what the club did well and poorly, what to maintain and what to change in the future.

On the subject of elections to fill our vacant exec board seats, we need nominations (including self-nominations). Anyone who wishes to fill or run to fill one of our open seats must be nominated and accept that nomination by Friday, December 6th. Elections (if one or more positions are contested) will happen at the first meeting of the spring. Open positions are: Vice President, Treasurer and Media Manager. Contact me with any questions or nominations.
