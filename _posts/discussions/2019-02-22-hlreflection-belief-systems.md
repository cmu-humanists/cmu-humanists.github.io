Beliefs sit somewhere between knowledge and speculation, but coming to understand just what beliefs are and more importantly, how we come to them is difficult. Belief systems are even more complex, and are often informed by our culture, friends, and family. They are usually defined as s set of values and moral stance that make up the majority of how people view whatâ€™s right and wrong to do in the world. The journey to a particular set of beliefs can be completely unexamined or very carefully developed, but does that make one better than the other? In other words does the way we came to our beliefs matter, or only their substance? How did you come to your belief system? What do you think impacted it the most? Has your belief system changed radically over time, if so why?
