Do our minds have systems that protect us from mind-parasites? The answer, surprisingly enough, is yes. Moreover, the parasites in question are nothing other than bad ideas. In this talk, philosopher Andy Norman will preview the argument of his forthcoming book. He’ll demonstrate that mental immune systems really do exist, and show that they have a decisive impact on our well-being. He’ll then describe how we can strengthen cognitive immune systems against the kind of breakdowns we’re witnessing in this "post-truth" era. With the tools of “cognitive immunology,” we can take critical thinking to an entirely new level.
