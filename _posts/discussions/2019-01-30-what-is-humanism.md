Humanism dates back to the Renaissance, and at its heart describes a paradigm shift in human reason starting in the 14th century. Humanism came to describe the new way people thought about the world and their place in it, and was marked by the belief that education in the arts, music, and sciences, could make life better for everyone. Since then humanism has grow to mean many different things to different people. Today, humanism as a philosophy for life is popular among secular people as an alternative to religious dogma that embraces empathy, the human capacity to reason, ethics, and truth. What does Humanism mean to you? What aspects of humanism appeal to you or leave you with question? Do you practice humanism in conjunction with other religious practices or other belief systems?
