Gender norms are the ways that we are expected to act, speak, dress, groom, and conduct ourselves based upon our biological sex. For example, women have typically been expected to be polite, accommodating, and nurturing, while men are generally expected to be strong, aggressive, and bold. They differ between cultures and generations, and often shape the way we see ourselves and set expectations for the behavior of others. What stance do you think humanism should have, if any, on gender norms? Are gender norms detrimental to our health and self concept, or are they beneficial and helpful in forming our identity? Is there a place for gender norms in our society, and if so what should they be?Â
