Throughout recorded history, humans have searched for God. From localized deities to religions as far-reaching as Christianity, people drew on life experiences, anecdotal stories, and their own faith to explain the world around them. Philosophers' struggles with free will and metaphysics often led them to contemplate how God factored in. We join generations of thinkers in attempting to answer the question: How plausible is it that a god exists, in some form?

There are many angles to approach this question from. Ancient civilizations looked for signs as proof of the existence of a god; what should we use today as our signs? Some believe that the suffering of the world implies the lack of a benevolent, omnipotent god. Some argue that the discovery of evolution signals that a creator god is less plausible. Yet others see a god as beyond human comprehension, pointless to characterize.

The form of a god's existence is also a subject of wide dispute. Within our diverse array of religions, can we determine whether it is the Abrahamic God, the millions of Hindu deities, or the Greek pantheon that truly reigns supreme? What about the possibility that no gods exist, or that we have yet to discover god? What evidence differentiates these stances from one another in terms of plausibility?
