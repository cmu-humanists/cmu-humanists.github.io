## Is it discovered or invented?

When natural scientists like Archimedes ran naked on the streets of Syracuse, he proclaimed "Eureka!" (I've *found* it.) But what should mathematicians proclaim when they complete the proof to a profound theorem? "I've *found* it," or "I've *made* it?" Is 1+1=2 in other universes, or even when the universe does not exist? (Whatever that means...)

It helps a little to watch this (layman's) [video on whether numbers exist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EGDCh75SpQ).
