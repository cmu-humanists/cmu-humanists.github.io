Should kids be taught religion?  Which one(s) and why?  In what way, and at what age? 

We'll watch a provocative video and discuss these important questions.  Over cookies.  Heinously delicious cookies.

At Humanist League, of course, food for thought is *always* on the menu.  We will watch a short TED talk in which philosopher Daniel Dennett (1) critiques megachurch pastor Rick Warren, and (2) argues that religion *should* be taught in our public schools.
