Is it the creation of beautiful things? Is it to evoke emotional responses? Is it the artist's self expression? Is the art piece valuable in itself, or does the creator's fame, effort, or intention play a central role? Does it even matter what Art is?

Here are some things that may challenge your notion of Art:
