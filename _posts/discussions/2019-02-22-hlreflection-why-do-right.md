Do you pick up garbage off the street when no one is looking? Do you donate to good causes anonymously? Do you do good deeds even when there is no obvious reward, besides a warm fuzzy feeling inside? What motivates you to take these actions? Why do we take the moral high ground in instances when not doing could be of greater personal benefit to ourselves? Why do we do the right thing in instances where you could do nothing, or destructive actions, without repercussions? If you donâ€™t do these things, what motivates you to have self interest over community interests?
