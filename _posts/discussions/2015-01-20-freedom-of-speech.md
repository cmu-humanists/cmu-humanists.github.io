## Are there limits and how best to defend it.

In the shadow of recent events in Paris, we have seen millions of people marching for the freedom of speech across France, chanting *Je Suis Charlie*. On the other hand, [journalists](http://www.theweek.co.uk/world-news/charlie-hebdo/62060/seven-reasons-why-people-are-saying-je-ne-suis-pas-charlie) and even [the Pope](http://time.com/3668875/pope-francis-charlie-hebdo/) have expressed the opinion that this freedom has its limits, and *Charlie Hebdo* should not be celebrated. What do you think? As humanists, what do we think can better promote human flourishing?
