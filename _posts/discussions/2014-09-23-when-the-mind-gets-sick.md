[According to the UN](http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=1545), 1 in 4 globally will experience mental health problems in their lifetime, and almost one million people die every year due to suicide. How are these people treated in the US and worldwide? What sorts of stigma do people have regarding psychological diseases? When someone acts or thinks abnormally, is it feature of their personality, or a sickness that took hold of their normal self?

People going through mental health problems deserve our care and understanding. How can we encourage each other to treat them with respect and dignity?
