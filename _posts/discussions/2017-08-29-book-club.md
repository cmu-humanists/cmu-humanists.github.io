We hope you've enjoyed reading Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie for our summer book club. Please join us for our first informal meeting of the year this Tuesday at 4:30 pm to talk about the book and catch up on any summer happenings. *You don't need to have read the book to come, although there may be spoilers!*
