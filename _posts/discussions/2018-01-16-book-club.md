Thanks to everyone who filled out the poll! The winner is The Dispossessed, by Ursula Le Guin! So grab yourself a copy of the book and read it over the winter break. We will then spend our first meeting back from break discussing the book, so be sure come with all your thoughts on Le Guin's utopian scifi novel about capitalism versus anarchism and individualism versus collectivism!

***Thank you for a wonderful semester and we look forward to seeing you next semester!***
