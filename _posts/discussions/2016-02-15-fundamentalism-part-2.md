Last week we looked at the roots and causes of fundamentalism and how it can lead to violence. This week we will discuss how to culturally combat fundamentalism. How we approach the issue of fundamentalism and who we choose to empower or blame has a profound impact on how this issue is viewed across the country and around the world. Fundamentalist ideologies have a narrative that is appealing to some people, and any attempt to combat that narrative should aim to be even more appealing.

How can we combat fundamentalism culturally?
Should we empower moderate beliefs in an ideology or religion, or do they legitimize extreme beliefs?
To what extent are members of an ideology or religion culpable for the extremists in their groups?
