From the more Utopian visions of a world like in Star Trek, Her, or Sir Thomas More's Utopia which coined the term Utopia. To the more Dystopian visions of Blade Runner, The Hunger Games, or Orwell's 1984. We have often thought of what our ideal world might look like. A world without suffering and illness, or poverty and greed, or a world where no has to work, or where all evil is eliminated. But perhaps Sir Thomas More was trying to tell us something about Utopia in the word he coined from the greek οὐ ("not") and τόπος ("place"), and so Utopia means "no-place". As the dystopian literature has shown us, a utopian vision could easily become twisted into dystopia if you're not careful what you wish for. In many ways our ideas about utopias and dystopias tell us about the kind of world we live in and our cultural aspirations and fears, and we maybe we learn something from them that helps us move towards a real life utopia, if that is indeed something we should strive for.

If you could construct the world to be how you think it should, what would it look like? How would you make such a world? What might the consequences be of making the world that way? Would you want to live in that world?
