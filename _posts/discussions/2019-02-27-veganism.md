Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. Vegans believe that our consumption choices can have a positive impact on animal welfare and the environment. What justification is there for veganism? Do animals deserve moral rights? Is changing our consumption an effective way of creating positive change, and if so, in what ways should we do so?

This week's blurb was written by Liam, a regular member of our Wednesday meetings.
