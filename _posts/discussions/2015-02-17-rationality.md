As humanists, we try to be rational in our worldview and beliefs. But psychology tells us that [we aren't rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality), and it doesn't seem likely we'll ever be fully rational. To what extent should we use rationality to make decisions, and how rational should we expect other people to be? To step back a bit, what even counts as a rational belief?
