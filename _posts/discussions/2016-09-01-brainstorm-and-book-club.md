# Brainstorm Topics for the Semester

For the first 45 minutes of tomorrow's meeting we'll be having an informal discussion on what topics we would like to discuss over the course of the semester. Perhaps you heard something over the summer that piqued your interest and would make a good discussion topic. Or maybe you want to revisit a previous topic from a new viewpoint. Or maybe you just met us at the ice cream social over the weekend and want to hear more about us.

There will be cookies!
 
# Book Club: American Gods

In the second part of the meeting we will be discussing the summer book club reading of American Gods by Neil Gaiman. Come discuss how Gaiman's novel of how ancient God's have gotten by in modern America reflects the state of beliefs in our society and more!
