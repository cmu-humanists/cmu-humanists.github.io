## Transcending and transforming what it means to be human

We have the technology to change ourselves for the better, just take a look at modern medicine. But how much change is too much? People have [inserted magnets](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-09/04/diy-biohacking) near their nerves to be able to "sense" magnetic fields, and David Eagleman's [texture vest](http://www.eagleman.com/research/sensory-substitution) might take advantage of human pattern recognition to create "senses" of all sorts of information! What if we could add extra memory to our brains for quicker and more reliable recall? There are so many examples, and so many questions. Is there anything inherently wrong with modifying our own bodies and brains? What if parents could make that choice for their children? Would such improvements be unfair to those who opted out if augmentations became necessary to compete?
