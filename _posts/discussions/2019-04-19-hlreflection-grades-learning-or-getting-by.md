As students, we have many different demands on our time and effort. Even within academics, we are pulled in many directions. Pulled towards getting better grades, pulled towards learning more knowledge, pulled towards taking more classes, or pulled in other directions.

How have you been pulled in your academics? How do have you responded to the demands on your time and energy? Do you take these approaches purposefully, or automatically? In retrospect, which approaches towards your classes have served you well in the long run?
