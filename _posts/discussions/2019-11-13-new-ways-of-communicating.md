The rise of the internet has seen a variety of new ways of receiving information and communicating. Social media allows and encourages people to show what they're up to, and have conversations, all in a maximally public setting. These conversations can look very different than the sort of conversations that people had before the internet existed. Such systems can encourage a superficial style of interaction, promote the loudest voices, spread false information and the creation of a divided bubble of information and interaction. They can also provide opportunities to meet people, make friends, and become exposed to a wider and potentially nicer spectrum of communities.

Which elements of internet-based communication structures encourage positive or negative interactions? If we were designing a new internet-based communication structure, how should it look? What do you think of Friended, (https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/friended-is-a-new-social-network-that-wants-to-get-real/) for instance, a social media platform based around encouraging one-on-one interactions instead of many-one or many-many?
