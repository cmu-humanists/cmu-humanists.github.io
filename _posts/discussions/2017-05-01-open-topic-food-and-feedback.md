Join us this Monday for the last meeting of the semester! Instead of a specific topic, we will have an open discussion about any topics the group would like to discuss and collectively reflect on what Humanist League has done this past semester.  What have you enjoyed about Humanist League so far? What have you not particularly liked? What things can we improve on? What topics, events and other ideas do you have in mind for next year?

We will be ordering pizza!
