# From a secular perspective

Death is a topic that secular people often have a hard time discussing, especially in times of grief, because it's not very comforting to think that there's nothing after death. But people who don't believe in an afterlife continually find meaning in their lives despite or as a result of this non-belief, so how can that attitude be extended and expressed to mourners in a positive way? Is afterlife really the most comforting idea?
