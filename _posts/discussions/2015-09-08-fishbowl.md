## A Casual Fish Bowl to Start the Year 

Since our first meeting (Sept. 8th) is happening before the activities fair, we're gonna take it easy, hang out, catch up, and have a fish bowl meeting. For those of you unfamiliar with the format, a fish bowl is where we pick topics/questions from a (fish) bowl and discuss them for shorter times instead of spending the whole meeting on one topic. The conversation is a little more casual, but the topics are just as good!
