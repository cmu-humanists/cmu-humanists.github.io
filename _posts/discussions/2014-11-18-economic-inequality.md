It is not difficult to see that income inequality in America has risen to historic highs (check out [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States)). According to Robert Reich in the acclaimed documentary *Inequality for All*, this not only lowers the financial well-being of American families, but also undermines democracy itself.
