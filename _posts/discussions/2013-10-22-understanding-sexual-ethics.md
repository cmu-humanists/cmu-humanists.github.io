## Does Robin Thicke's popular song "Blurred Lines" endorse date rape? What forms of sexual behavior "cross the line," and how is one to know?

Are the guilt and shame that so many feel about their sexuality natural and inevitable? Or are they learned? Where do these negative attitudes come from, and can they be replaced with more positive attitudes? Are religious sexual taboos rooted in sound moral intuitions, or arbitrary strictures? What are the alternatives to faith-based sexual ethics? Do they make sense?
