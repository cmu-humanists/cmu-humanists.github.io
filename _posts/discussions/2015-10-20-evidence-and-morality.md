## More than just gut feelings and authorities

Humanists strive to build moral beliefs that are well grounded in reality. We carefully examine the effects of our actions and decisions: avoiding what harms, and doing what benefits. We understand that gut feelings and authorities may not always be right, but we have real-world evidence to keep us in check.

If our decisions are purely based on consequences, then where does that leave such Virtues as Honesty, Loyalty, and Filial Piety? Are actions good or bad in themselves, independent of their outcomes? Is there something more than just evidence that should guide our morality? [This short article gives a concise example of such a moral conflict.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1230479/pdf/cmaj_161_3_229.pdf)
