At our film screening of "A Better Life" this past Tuesday, we saw some ways that atheists find joy and meaning in life. The people interviewed talked about relationships with others, finding our place in a larger story, and how non-religious people think about death and life. Many of them also claimed that religious ideas of afterlife can cheapen the value of this life. At our meeting this week, we will discuss these topics and more! How do non-religious people find meaning and purpose in life, and could it be better that way? 

You **do not** have to have seen the film to participate in this discussion!
