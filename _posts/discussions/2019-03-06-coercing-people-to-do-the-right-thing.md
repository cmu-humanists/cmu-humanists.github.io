Some people if given the opportunity will do the right thing out of the kindness of their hearts, but not everyone will. Given that all else being equal we would prefer that people do the right thing, when is it appropriate to coerce them to
do it? Coercion can take many forms, from the threat of life in prison or the electric chair to to an unkind glare or a plea "please don't". Do you have a responsibility to coerce others to do the right thing or is coercion itself immoral? What difference does it make if the person you coerce is a friend or
family member?
