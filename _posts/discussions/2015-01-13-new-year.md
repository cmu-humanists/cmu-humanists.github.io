## Happy New Year
Thanks to all of you for an amazing semester at Humanist League. We've discussed topics ranging from mental health to economic inequality, hosted four speaker events, and had a bunch of get-togethers and dinners. This would not have been possible without your enthused participation.

Let's make 2015 even greater!

## Get-Together
I'm sure lots of fun things have happened in your break. Let's share all the fun we've had, the family gatherings, religious services, travelling... over some **_tasty snacks!_** On the other hand, let us also take some time to remember the lives lost to natural and human disasters in the past few weeks.
