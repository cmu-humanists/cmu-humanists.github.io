Some believe emotions are required to make moral decisions because not doing so could lead to many problems being overlooked and could ultimately cause greater harm than anticipated. They may also believe it is extremely difficult, as humans, to truly separate emotions from our rationale.

Alternatively, some believe that emotions may cloud our judgement, and so they donâ€™t think emotions are required to make moral decisions. They may argue that emotions can cause us to jump to conclusions or have biased answers. Therefore, proponents of this school of thought believe there should be no emotional attachment to the problem at hand when trying to find a fair answer.

Should emotions be kept out of moral decisions, or should they influence our decisions? Are emotions needed to make moral decisions, or are they optional? What weight should be given to emotional considerations, and what weight should be given to other kinds of thought?
