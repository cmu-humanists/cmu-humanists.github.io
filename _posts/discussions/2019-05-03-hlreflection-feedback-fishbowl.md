Join us Friday for the last Friday meeting of the semester! Instead of a specific topic, we will spend the time   reflecting on Friday meetings which we implemented this year. It will also be a good opportunity to hear your feedback on these meetings specifically, and what we can improve. If there is time at the end we will also have a time for whatever topics you want to talk about over a fishbowl.
