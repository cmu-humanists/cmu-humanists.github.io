## A Discussion and Presentation by Akshat Gupta
How do we know if a particular perspective is Humanistic? Does Humanism necessitate atheism? Do Humanists need to care about social justice and why? Isn't everyone already a Humanist?

In this presentation, Akshat will attempt to answer some of these questions that constantly nag the Humanist community. We will then have a thorough discussion on our own understanding of what Humanism or a Humanist is.
