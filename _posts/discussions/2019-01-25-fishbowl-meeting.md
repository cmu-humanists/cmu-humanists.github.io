Welcome back after the long weekend! Join us this Friday at 4:30 in PH A19 for a relaxed discussion on a variety of topics! Instead of having a specific topic beforehand, we will have an open discussion about any topics the group would like to discuss. So come to the meeting with a few interesting ideas you'd want to discuss. We'll have everyone submit their topics to the fishbowl, out of which topics will be randomly drawn and we'll collectively decide if we want to talk about it, and how long to talk about it. It'll be a fun time!
