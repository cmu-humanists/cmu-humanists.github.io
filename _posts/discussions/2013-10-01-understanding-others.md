Humanists like to understand how different people see the world. We also like to practice the art of dialogue that bridges worldviews.  As part of this ongoing project, we meet this afternoon with a lively representative of a small religious denomination known as The New Church, a religion inspired by the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg.

Ned Uber, a thoughtful and interesting representative of the New Church, will join us Tuesday October 1st, from 4:30-5:30.  Come learn with us!
