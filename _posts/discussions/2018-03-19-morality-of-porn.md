The morality of porn is a contentious topic for a variety of reasons. Porn production, religious beliefs, and perceived positive or negative effects on oneself or others (among other reasons) can all play a role in personal and philosophical positions on whether porn is good or bad.

Porn production is often a significant consideration when people discuss whether the existence of porn (as opposed to its consumption) is moral. Porn actors have been exploited in the creation of some films in the form of exploitation and misinformation, and some films may be produced illegally. For example, an actor may have been told that she had to perform a certain sexual act, or been told that a sexual act would not be damaging when it would actually cause severe physical damage. Rosebudding, also known as anal prolapse in the medical world, is an unfortunate example of a growing porn trend that causes/requires physical damage for an actor to perform. Ethical porn is also available where the directors put ethical production and treatment of the actors at the focus of their business.

Besides the production, many people take stances on porn based on its perceived effects, with varying levels of evidence. Potential benefits include sexual pleasure, control over their own sexuality, sex education, increased exploration by themselves or with partners, better relationships, and greater sexual satisfaction. Potential negative effects include porn-induced erectile dysfunction, porn addiction, worsened body image, lessened attraction to partners, and lessened desire to have sex. In the case of children, many people also worry that exposure to porn can upset sexual or emotional development and ideas of how sex and relationships should develop. Religion is a common principled objection to the viewing of porn, with various mainstream religions taking a stance that porn and masturbation are morally wrong.

Is it unethical for pornographic films with (sometimes severe) risks to actors to be produced? What about if the actor knew the risks beforehand? Is it unethical to view these films? Does ethical porn fix the problem? Do the potential effects on children matter to our general consumption? Do other porn mediums (written erotica, pictures, audio) have a different moral standard? How do religious beliefs affect the moral stance on porn? Do the potential benefits or detriments allow us to make a general moral judgement on porn?
