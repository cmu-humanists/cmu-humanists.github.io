## A Presentation by Gina Casalegno, Dean of Student Affairs
The university updated the [policies on sexual harassment](http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/SA_SH.htm) last September. The dean of student affairs, **Gina Casalegno**, is very keen on receiving some feedback from the student community. She will be giving a short presentation at our regular meeting on Tuesday on these policies, followed by a discussion on the broader issue.

How do we raise awareness on the harms of sexual harassment on college campuses? Where is the line between permissible display of romantic interest and inappropriate behaviours? In California, a law was passed to require state-funded schools to have explicit policy on "no sex without express consent". Is this a good law? What counts as express consent?
