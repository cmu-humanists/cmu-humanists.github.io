Social anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates self-governed societies based on voluntary institutions. These are often described as stateless societies, or non-hierarchical associations as opposed to institutions. Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful.

While social anarchism is just one of many branches of anarchist theory, it emphasizes mutual aid, community decision making, and individual equality. Social anarchists advocate the conversion of present-day private property into social property or the commons, while still retaining a respect for personal property.

The term "social anarchism" is often used interchangeably with libertarian socialism, left-libertarianism, or left anarchism. It emerged in the late 19th century as a distinction from individualist anarchism.

What do you think of social anarchy? Can a social anarchist society viably exist? Would you support communal ownership over private ownership? Would you want to live in an anarchist community?
