This evening, Jonathan Haidt spoke for our annual Sagan day, to discuss the growingly polarized society we have found ourselves in. This week at the Humanist League, we’ll be discussing Dr. Haidt’s lecture. If you had a chance to here him speak, come share your thoughts. And if you weren’t able to make it, you can still share your thoughts on what other have to share.
