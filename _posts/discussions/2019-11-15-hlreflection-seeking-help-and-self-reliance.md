When we encounter difficult situations in our lives, there are two routes we can take: We can attempt to handle the situation on our own, with the resources at our own disposal, or we can reach out to others for help.

The question gets harder to answer when the difficult situation is a recurring one, not a one-off situation. When the difficult situation seems within our control. When the failing feels like a failing of character or of morals, rather than a failing of circumstance or ability.

How does one handle a situation like this? What is a good outcome? What is a stable endpoint? What have such struggles between self-reliance and reaching out looked like in your life?
