The Me Too movement (or "#MeToo") is a hashtag used to express solidarity in experiencing sexual assault and to demonstrate the prevalence of sexual misconduct in modern society. The phrase was previously used in this context by Tarana Burke in 2006 and was popularized by Alyssa Milano in October 2017.

Since then, the phrase, usually with an accompanying personal story, has been shared online millions of times all around the world, in multiple languages and with a variety of spinoffs for unique subgroups. High-profile celebrities have come forth with their personal stories such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Ashley Judd, Jennifer Lawrence, Uma Thurman, and Terry Crews. It has also brought to light allegations against Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, and Louis C. K.

#MeToo has reached a critical point where social scientists are suggesting it is capable of changing culture. Multiple men have resigned in light of allegations against them. Policies around sexual harassment and rape kits have been updated in schools, military, and government. Greater emphasis has been placed on the importance reporting abuse, especially among male peers. Traditional gender norms around sexual behavior and consent have been challenged.

What other ways has the #MeToo movement impacted culture? How has this phenomena impacted you? Where do you see this movement going in the future? Why do you think it has taken this long for it to have happened?
