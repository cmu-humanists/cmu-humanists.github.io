Content distraction: The tendency to get caught up in following some kind of engaging content, whether social media, internet articles, watching TV, etc. Often, the content can be engaging even when it isn't enjoyable or constructive, leading us down an undesirable path in how we spend our time.

Have you noticed this tendency in yourself? How have you shaped it to be more positive in your life? How do you want to handle content distraction in the future?
