The poll has spoken and discussion meetings for the semester will be held on Mondays at 4:30. Join us for the first meeting of the year today, at our new room Wean 5312. We will catch up and also chat informally about the book we read over break, Catch 22. Even if you haven't read the book, join us as we discuss the general themes of war and insanity. We'll also discuss upcoming plans for the semester.
