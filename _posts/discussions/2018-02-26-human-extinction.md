Many believe that the human species, and all of its accompanying knowledge, will die one day. Why? Some argue the probability that we make a fatal mistake is high enough that we must eventually succumb to it.  Others think that humanity is inherently unjust, and some external enforcement of justice will be our downfall. Are they right? Is the continued existence of our species determined by our actions? Would it be just for our species, or our civilization, or our knowledge to end? Will the human race go extinct?
