Will we want to live in a world where a digital barrier exists between reality and our senses? 

Technologies such as Google Glass may improve our ability to sea, hear, and perhaps even to feel and to taste. 

However, will we lose an aspect of what makes us human by experiencing the world indirectly through technology, as opposed to directly through our senses? Is such a virtual experience *inferior* to the real one?

In a nutshell, will augmented reality diminish our **humanity**?
