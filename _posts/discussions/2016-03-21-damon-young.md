This meeting, we are having Pittsburgh's own Damon Young join us for discussion! He is a writer and activist, and we've invited Damon to educate and discuss with us the complexity of race relations in America today. The discussion will be moderated as usual, but not guided, so come with questions! For some background information and examples of his writing, I've copied some links below!
