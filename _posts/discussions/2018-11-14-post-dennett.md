Last week during our annual Carl Sagan Day Fest, Dr. Daniel Dennett spoke to us about free will, consciousness, and autonomy. He discussed the concept of free will, and the various philosophical interpretations and theories it is entangled with. Finally asserting that we do have free will, in a sense, he ultimately refuted the idea that we free from the responsibility of our choices, and concluded that we are more autonomous than robots or cells. These issues of consciousness and autonomy were central to Dr. Dennetts conclusions around free will. Now we want to hear what you have to say about them. Do you agree, and what other questions did you have after the talk? 
This conversation will be very general, and if you didnâ€™t make it to Carl Sagan Day still feel free to join us!
