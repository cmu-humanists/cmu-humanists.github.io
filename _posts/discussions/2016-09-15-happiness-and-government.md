Governments greatly influence the way their citizens live, feel, and act, and the laws made by the government impact its citizensâ€™ happiness. For example, in the 1920s the US government made its citizens unhappy when alcohol became illegal, while in 2015 the LGBTQ citizens of the United States rejoiced when they were guaranteed the right to marry in all 50 states. When the citizens of a country are happy, the country runs smoother, and in extreme cases when the citizens are unhappy, they may overthrow the government. But should happiness be the goal of government? If not happiness, what should the goal of government be?
