As a first-time collaboration between Humanist League and ALLIES, the LGBTQ awareness group at CMU, we will discuss issues regarding the acceptance of all genders and sexual orientations. How far have we gone? What about the rest of the 51 gender options on Facebook? How can other underprivileged groups learn from the "coming out of the closet" campaign?
