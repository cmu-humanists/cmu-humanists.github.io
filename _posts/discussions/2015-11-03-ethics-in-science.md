Scientific advances in the 20th century brought humanity unprecedented benefits in how we live our lives. However, science and technology can also have a dark side in it's effects. Nuclear proliferation and environmental degradation are among the greatest challenges we face. Ethical issues remain in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloning and automated warfare. Scientists have even used psychological science to help with the government torture program. Some argue that science has a bias toward discovering and inventing first, and thinking of the ethical consequences later. 
 

Has scientific and technological innovation been shielded from serious ethical inquiry, and why?

Should scientists be held responsible for the negative consequences of past and future innovations?

How can we foster ethical norms in scientific culture and institutions?
