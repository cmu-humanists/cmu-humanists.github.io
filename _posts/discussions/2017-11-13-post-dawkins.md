In our last email we sent out a poll for the next meeting topic and the results are in! At our next meeting this Monday, we will have a post Dawkins Unplugged discussion. We can discuss anything and everything regarding what Richard Dawkins talked about on Tuesday during Carl Sagan Fest. Dawkins' shared his thoughts on a wide variety topics, such as the selfish gene, labeling children, scientific morality, vegetarianism and pain. Did you agree with what Dawkins had to say? What questions were you left with?
