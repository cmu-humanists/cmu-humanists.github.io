What do Ted Bundy and pouring your milk before your Frosted Flakes™ have in common? If you said cereal/serial, you would be incorrect. The correct answer is that both Ted Bundy’s actions and carelessly splashing milk all over your families mahogany table like a psychopath, are ethically wrong.

If you disagree with me, this week’s topic is for you. How did you arrive at this conclusion and decide what is classified as right and wrong? What are ethics? How do we arrive at them? How do ethics differ from morals? Why do we even have ethics? What do people mean when they say good and bad (or maybe even evil)?
