Join us Wednesday for the last meeting of the semester! Instead of a specific topic, we will spend the time collectively reflecting on what Humanist League has done this past semester. It will also be a good opportunity to hear feedback from you on how our organization has been doing. What have you enjoyed about Humanist League so far? What have you not particularly liked? What things can we improve on? What topics, events and other ideas do you have in mind for next semester?

We will hold an election for one Exec position (Treasurer) at the beginning of the meeting, so make sure to arrive at 4:30pm if you want to vote!
