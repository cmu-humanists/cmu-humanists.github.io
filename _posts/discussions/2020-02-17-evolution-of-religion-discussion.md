Last Wednesday, James Croft, the Outreach Director of the Ethical Society of St. Louis, came to speak about the evolution of religion, and the formation of secular moral communities. He discussed the ancient origins of religion, what religions provide to the people who follow them, and what a "religion" looks like without a belief in God. 

This upcoming Monday at the Humanist League, we’ll be discussing Croft’s lecture together. If you had a chance to come hear him speak, come share your thoughts. And if you weren’t able to make it, you can still come and share your thoughts on our discussion as it unfolds.
