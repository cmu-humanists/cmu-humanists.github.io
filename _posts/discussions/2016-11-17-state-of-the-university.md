# Faith and Reason
As voted on in last week's meeting, we will be attending the State of the University discussion this week in lieu of our regular meeting. This event is 4:30-6:30pm on Thursday in Doherty A302, and the topic is how faith fits into a secular university.

From their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/events/523571107850468/): "State of the University as a series brings together staff, faculty and students to talk and learn about important topics that affect our community. Come to the next installment of the State of the University discussion series to discuss faith and reason in today's society. We will be discussing multiple topics including religious discrimination, the different beliefs we bring to our CMU community and how faith can fit in at a secular university. Feel free to come participate in our five chair format or just come and listen! Everyone is welcome!"
