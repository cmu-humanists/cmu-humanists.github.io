There are many different ways that people react when they realize their opinion (moral or factual) is wrong. Some continue to argue for that point, or some will admit that they are wrong and retract their statement. Ideally, all people should have the latter reaction, but many of us experience hesitation to change our minds for a variety of reasons.

How do you react when you realize your opinion is wrong or you no longer see the validity in your original opinion? Is your reaction what you think it should be? If not, how would you like to change it, and how would you like others to react when they have their own realization?
